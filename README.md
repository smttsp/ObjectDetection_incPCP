Submitted at 14 May 2017


incPCP code has been obtained from https://sites.google.com/a/istec.net/prodrig/Home/en/pubs/incpcp
 
We built our updates on it. Some of the things we have done are as follows:

1. Stabilizating the videos
2. Depth estimation
3. Object Separation
4. Eroding, Dilation
5. Adding Bounding box, removing inner boxes
6. Coloring the objects
